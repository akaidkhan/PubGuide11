    <string name="miramar">Miramar is a desert map in Player Unknowns’s
        Battlegrounds (PUBG) that features urban surroundings based in
        Mexico. Its terrain offers many opportunities for interesting
        gameplay because it can be used more for ambushing, sniping and
        long-range shooting. But with Miramar’s long stretches of desert
        and densely populated cities, the tactics typically used in Erangel
        , Vikendi and Sanhok may not work and new strategies are required.</string>
